The Square Bracket Hack Prevention plugin prevents hackers from adding a "[" to the URL.

== Description ==

The Square Bracket Hack Prevention plugin prevents a simple but very common exploit of WordPress, by adding in a .htaccess rule upon activation preventing hackers from adding a "[" to the URL.

A common attempt at a WPSOS exploit is to add a "[" to a URL, which can often break a site and expose an ability to inject code. This plugin stops it by banning all attempts at adding a "[" to the URL. It does so via adding code to the .htaccess file. 

Additionally, upon the uninstallation of the plugin, the line is removed. And if the .htaccess file is not editable, then the admin user is warned.

NB! If the .htaccess file wasn't writeable during the activation, please make .htaccess writeable, and deactivate and activate the plugin again.
